# Gov 52 Final Replication Project: 
### Policy or Partisanship: Replicating Results From An Analysis of Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Brexit

#### Trisha Prabhu; Spring 2021

### Description of files:

This repo contains 1 key file: "policyorpartisanship_brextianalysis.Rmd," the
Rmd file that contains all of the code used in the creation of this final 
replication project. This Rmd file also contains all of the commentary/
interpretation associated with the replicated results. Note that 
policyorpartisanship_brextianalysis.pdf is the knitted version of this Rmd file.

"deletedcode.R" contains code that I explored in the creation of this 
replication, but ultimately did not include.
