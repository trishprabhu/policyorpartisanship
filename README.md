# Gov 52 Final Replication Project: 
### Policy or Partisanship: Replicating Results From An Analysis of Quasi-Experimental Evidence From Brexit

#### Trisha Prabhu; Spring 2021

### Description of files:

This repo contains 1 key file: "policyorpartisanship_brextianalysis.Rmd," the
Rmd file that contains all of the code used in the creation of this final 
replication project. This Rmd file also contains all of the commentary/
interpretation associated with the various components of the project, from the
replicated results, to my extension. Note that 
"policyorpartisanship_brextianalysis.pdf" is the knitted version of this Rmd 
file.

There are also a few other files:

"deletedcode.R" contains code that I explored in the creation of this 
replication, but ultimately did not include. It's include here for future
reference, if necessary.

Finally, the "BES" files are the various waves of data of the British Election
Study used in the authors' original paper/my replication.

### How to run the code/the output that is produced:

First, download the repo's contents. Open the .Rmd file; then, execute each
chunk of code, from top to bottom, in order. You should be able to produce all
6 tables/the 2 figures included in the authors' original paper (this is the 
replication of their results), followed by an extension in which I explore 
employing another regression method, logistic regression, to run the authors 
most important analyses. If you knit the .Rmd file (or open the associated 
.pdf file), you will also see the associated written commentary.

### A record of my computational environment:
* Operating system: macOS High Sierra (Version 10.13.6)
* R Version: 4.0.2
* R packages used: foreign, tidyverse, ggplot2, arm, stargazer, janitor, 
ggthemes, dplyr, packrat, sjPlot, cowplot; all latest version as of 04/2021
